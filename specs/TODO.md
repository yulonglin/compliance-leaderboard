First, copy this over to format and generate the report: /Users/yulong/Downloads/iclr2026

Look at the code and results we currently have in this repo. Then consider what we could write up to address the judging criteria and categories below

Then, based on the following, write a 4-page report, moving other things to the Appendix: /Users/yulong/writing/brainstorming/ideas/20260131-204007-technical-ai-governance-hackathon-projects

Note the judging criteria at: /Users/yulong/writing/brainstorming/ideas/20260131-204007-technical-ai-governance-hackathon-projects/resources/judging-criteria.md and also the proposals at that location

Plan and think first. Use @paper-writer and /research-presentation
