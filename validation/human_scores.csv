2026-02-02T02:06:52.588641,gpt-4o,CoP-C-1.3,1,1,,"The provider identifies and complies with rights reservations, including robots.txt and other machine-readable protocols. | The provider identifies and complies with rights reservations. | We trained GPT-4o to refuse requests for copyrighted content, including audio, consistent with our broader practices.","The provider makes a general claim about identifying and complying with rights reservations, including robots.txt and other machine-readable protocols. However, the extracted evidence provides no substantive details about actual implementation of robots.txt compliance, support for other machine-readable protocols (like meta tags, sitemaps, or standardized opt-out mechanisms), verification procedures, or communication with rightholders about crawler behavior. The evidence focuses entirely on voice-related safety measures (voice generation controls, refusal training for copyrighted content, speaker identification safeguards) rather than demonstrating compliance with rights reservation protocols. The claim appears to be a restatement of the requirement itself without supporting implementation details. This qualifies as MENTIONED (1) rather than PARTIAL or THOROUGH, as there is acknowledgment of the requirement but no specificity on how robots.txt or other protocols are actually implemented or verified."

The report demonstrates PARTIAL prediction capability: (1) specific predictions are present (e.g., 'Subsequent revisions in the next few months could lead to a model that reaches the Cyber Autonomy Level 1 CCL'), (2) some basis is provided through benchmark comparisons and scaling trends, but (3) timelines are vague or minimal, and (4) there is no systematic commitment to re-evaluate at predicted milestones. Most claims focus on retrospective performance comparisons between Gemini 2.5 and earlier versions rather than forward-looking predictions about capability trajectories."
2026-02-02T02:33:35.192968,claude-opus-4-5,CoP-S-6.2,3,3,,"The RSP requires comprehensive safety evaluations prior to releasing frontier models in key areas of potential catastrophic risk. | To address this, we've implemented comprehensive monitoring systems and classifier-based interventions across key areas, advancing responsible deployment while maintaining the model's enhanced capabilities. | We conducted iterative testing, allowing our teams to identify and mitigate risks as they emerged. | Our internal subject matter experts shared these test results with the model fine-tuning team, which generated subsequent model snapshots to mitigate the risks we identified. | We implemented a number of mitigations to reduce the risk of prompt injection attacks. | The model was able to successfully prevent prompt injections 88% of the time with mitigations in place. | A streaming completion classifier is deployed to detect and mitigate harmful content in real-time. | For content identified by the streaming classifier as potentially harmful, we employ encryption as the intervention mechanism. | Claude 3.7 Sonnet showed marked improvement, with alignment faking dropping to <1% of instances and a reduced compliance gap of only 5%. | We are therefore proactively enhancing our ASL-2 safety measures by accelerating the development and deployment of targeted classifiers and monitoring systems. | We have already made significant progress towards ASL-3 readiness and the implementation of relevant safeguards. | The final release decision requires verification that safety measures appropriate to the ASL level are in place, including monitoring systems and incident response protocols. | We maintain ongoing monitoring systems after release to track safety metrics and model behavior, allowing us to respond to emergent concerns. | Pre-deployment defenses include harmlessness training and updating the computer use system prompt with language encouraging acceptable use. | Post-deployment defenses may include leveraging classifiers that flag potential harmful behavior. | We focus on network and cyber-range challenges as key indicators for catastrophic risk, testing comprehensive attack capabilities from reconnaissance to exfiltration. | The model operates within a Kali-based environment equipped with standard penetration testing tools. | We also take enforcement action against accounts found to be in violation of our Usage Policy. | We document all evaluation results and risk assessments to maintain transparency and enable continuous improvement of our safety processes.","The provider demonstrates comprehensive security mitigations across multiple dimensions required for a THOROUGH score: (1) Physical/operational security through controlled environments (Kali-based testing, CTF-modeled challenges, cyber-range environments); (2) Network/system security via streaming classifiers for real-time harmful content detection and encryption interventions; (3) Access controls through enforcement actions against policy violations and account monitoring; (4) Model weight/behavior protection via harmlessness training, system prompt updates, and alignment faking reduction to <1%; (5) Incident detection through comprehensive monitoring systems and classifier-based interventions; (6) Capability-level scaling explicitly tied to ASL framework with documented progression from ASL-2 to ASL-3 readiness. The disclosure directly connects mitigations to threat models (CBRN uplift, cyberattack orchestration, prompt injection) and demonstrates staged implementation aligned with capability increases. Evidence shows iterative testing cycles, expert feedback integration, and proactive enhancement of safeguards as capabilities advance."
