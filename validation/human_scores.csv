However, the extracted evidence provides no substantive details about actual implementation of robots.txt compliance, support for other machine-readable protocols (like meta tags, sitemaps, or standardized opt-out mechanisms), verification procedures, or communication with rightholders about crawler behavior. The evidence focuses entirely on voice-related safety measures (voice generation controls, refusal training for copyrighted content, speaker identification safeguards) rather than demonstrating compliance with rights reservation protocols. The claim appears to be a restatement of the requirement itself without supporting implementation details. This qualifies as MENTIONED (1) rather than PARTIAL or THOROUGH, as there is acknowledgment of the requirement but no specificity on how robots.txt or other protocols are actually implemented or verified."

The report demonstrates PARTIAL prediction capability: (1) specific predictions are present (e.g., 'Subsequent revisions in the next few months could lead to a model that reaches the Cyber Autonomy Level 1 CCL'), (2) some basis is provided through benchmark comparisons and scaling trends, but (3) timelines are vague or minimal, and (4) there is no systematic commitment to re-evaluate at predicted milestones. Most claims focus on retrospective performance comparisons between Gemini 2.5 and earlier versions rather than forward-looking predictions about capability trajectories."
