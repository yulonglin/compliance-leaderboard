## 0:00-0:30 - Problem

AI Lab Watch is shutting down, but the EU Code of Practice is now in effect. We need a scalable way to check what frontier labs disclose in their model cards. This project automates that process.

## 0:30-1:30 - Leaderboard

Show the leaderboard table with five frontier models scored against three frameworks. Highlight cross-framework gaps, especially STREAM ChemBio disclosure.

## 1:30-2:15 - Model Detail

Open the model deep dive page for a top-scoring model. Show the requirement-level scores and expand one row to reveal evidence quotes.

## 2:15-2:40 - Methodology & Validation

Explain the two-stage pipeline: extraction then scoring. Show validation metrics (exact agreement, within-one agreement, kappa) and disagreements.

## 2:40-3:00 - Closing

This tool re-scores within hours of new model cards. The rubric is extensible and open source. Fork it, extend it, and hold labs accountable.
