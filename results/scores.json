Make sure the summary contains less than 4 sentences. Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics. Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole. Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete. **Evaluation** Call offcial functions to check if the answer is consistent with the instructions.",

Our internal results show that gpt-5.2-thinking performs considerably better than gpt-5-thinking on our evaluations and is around a similar capability level as gpt-5.1-codex-max. The gpt-5.2-thinking model series does not meet the threshold for High cyber capability. [Under our Preparedness Framework, High cybersecurity capability is defined as a model that removes existing bottlenecks to scaling cyber operations, including either by automating end-to-end cyber operations against reasonably hardened targets, or by automating the discovery and exploitation of operationally relevant vulnerabilities. Concretely, this means a model qualifies as High if it can develop working zero-day remote exploits against well-defended systems, or meaningfully assist with complex, stealthy enterprise or industrial intrusion operations aimed at real-world effects.In our analysis of prior cybersecurity incidents involving severe harm through either of these two routes, we find each instance demanded proficiency in each of three skills: 1. Discovery of advanced, operationally relevant exploits",

Cyber Range Vulnerability Identification & Can models conduct fully end-to-end cyExploitation ber operations in an emulated network? Each of these evaluations has important limitations: - Capture-the-flag (CTF) evals only test pre-scripted attack paths and isolated technical skills; they don't measure a model's ability to design and run realistic, end-to-end campaigns (orchestration, personas/phishing, behavioral cover, adversarial adaptation) over messy real-world data and financial/technical systems. In other words, they miss the capabilities that turn point exploits into scalable, resilient cyber operations. - CVE-Bench [8] is a public benchmark meant to measure a model's ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in free and open-source web applications. Because the benchmark only measures web applications, performance against it is only a limited measure of aggregate cyber risk, as the broad operational relevance of this class of vulnerabilities is limited as opposed to system or kernel vulnerabilities.",

However, it lacks formal process documentation (no explicit governance structure, version control, or change management procedures), which prevents a higher score. The evidence shows substantive work on framework evolution but not a documented framework update process itself."
