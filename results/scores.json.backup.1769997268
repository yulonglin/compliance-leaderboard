While it provides concrete numbers (10-50 attempts, 3750 total prompts for memorization), the core elicitation methodology lacks specificity needed for reproduction. The report defers to external references (Gemini Team 2024) rather than detailing prompts here. CBRN evaluation types are named (MCQs, OEQs) but no examples provided. The 'simple harness' description is vague\u2014what exactly is the system prompt? How are follow-ups structured? The pathfinder example shows prompts exist but doesn't provide the systematic approach. This reads as checkbox compliance ('we tested with prompts') rather than genuine methodological transparency."
